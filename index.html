    <h3>MY HOBBY IS TO DO CODING</h3><br><br>
    <section id="bio">

        <p>Coding is my hobby. I love to code because it is fun and it makes a difference in people's life. I like to make games, apps, webpage and many more, on different different coding platforms like brackets, Codepen, thunkable, code.org etc. From that I get lots of knowledge of coding. Programming is fundamentally creating solutions to problem. I love it because it improves our memory, problem solving skills and cognitive skills all well. It also increases our logical skill and creativity and makes our brain busy and healthy. With the help of coding I understand the world better around me. I am always happy when I do coding and I thank my coding teacher miss. Anusha mam for teaching me coding and she always motivating me and my ceativity.</p>
